Honouring God means to acknowledge Him as the source of everything we have and everything we are. It means to give Him the glory, praise, and thanks for all His blessings and benefits. It also means to obey His commands, follow His will, and trust His promises. When we honour God, we align ourselves with His purpose and plan for our lives. We also invite His favour, grace, and power to work on our behalf.
 
The Bible teaches us that honouring God is the gateway to success. In Proverbs 3:5-6, it says: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight." In Joshua 1:8, it says: "Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful." In Psalm 1:1-3, it says: "Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not witherâwhatever they do prospers."
 
These verses show us that when we honour God by trusting Him, obeying Him, and meditating on His word, He will guide us, bless us, and prosper us. He will make our paths straight, meaning He will remove the obstacles and difficulties that hinder our progress. He will make us fruitful and productive in whatever we do. He will also protect us and sustain us in times of trouble.
 
Therefore, if we want to achieve success in life, we should not rely on our own wisdom or strength, but on God's wisdom and strength. We should not seek worldly fame or fortune, but God's glory and kingdom. We should not compromise our integrity or values, but uphold God's standards and principles. We should honour God with our whole heart, soul, mind, and strength. As we do so, we will experience His presence, peace, joy, and love. We will also witness His miracles, wonders, and breakthroughs. We will discover that honouring God is the gateway to success.
  
How can we honour God in our daily lives? Here are some practical ways to do so:
 
- Worship Him. Worship is not just singing songs or attending church services. Worship is expressing our love, admiration, and gratitude to God for who He is and what He has done. We can worship God through our words, actions, and attitudes. We can worship God in the morning, in the evening, and throughout the day. We can worship God in private, in public, and with others.
- Pray to Him. Prayer is not just asking God for things or reciting memorized phrases. Prayer is communicating with God as our Father, Friend, and Helper. We can pray to God about anything and everything. We can pray to God with honesty, humility, and faith. We can pray to God in silence, in words, and in the Spirit. We can pray to God anytime, anywhere, and anyhow.
- Read His word. Reading the Bible is not just a duty or a habit. Reading the Bible is discovering God's character, will, and promises. We can read the Bible with interest, curiosity, and eagerness. We can read the Bible with understanding, application, and meditation. We can read the Bible daily, systematically, and devotionally.
- Serve Him. Serving God is not just doing tasks or fulfilling obligations. Serving God is using our gifts, talents, and resources to glorify Him and bless others. We can serve God with joy, passion, and excellence. We can serve God in our family, in our workplace, and in our community. We can serve God by sharing the gospel, by helping the needy, and by making disciples.
- Give to Him. Giving to God is not just donating money or things. Giving to God is acknowledging His ownership and generosity over everything we have. We can give to God with gratitude, generosity, and cheerfulness. We can give to God our tithes, our offerings, and our firstfruits. We can give to God by supporting His church, His mission, and His kingdom.

As we honour God in these ways, we will grow in our relationship with Him. We will also enjoy His presence and power in our lives. We will see His hand of provision and protection over us. We will witness His grace and favour upon us. We will experience His success and prosperity for us.
 
Honouring God is not a burden or a sacrifice. Honouring God is a privilege and a blessing. Honouring God is the gateway to success.
